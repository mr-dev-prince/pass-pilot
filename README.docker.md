## Overview

- Pass-Pilot is a [brief description of your application, e.g., "web application built with Node.js and Express, providing a REST API for managing user data"]. 
- This repository includes a Dockerfile for containerizing the application and a docker-compose.yml for orchestrating services.

## Prerequisites

## Docker: Install Docker from Docker's official website. 

- Ensure the Docker CLI and Docker Compose plugin are available.

Verify installation:
docker version
docker compose version

Project Structure
├── Dockerfile          # Defines the Docker image for the application
├── .dockerignore       # Specifies files to exclude from the Docker build
├── docker-compose.yml  # Defines services, networks, and volumes

└── README.md           # This file

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
cd [your-repo-name]


Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory (if required).
Example .env:PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=[your-database-connection-string]
[other environment variables]


Ensure .env is listed in .dockerignore to prevent it from being copied into the image.


Build the Docker Image:
docker build -t [your-app-name]:latest .



Running the Application
Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

Start the application and its services:
docker compose up --build

This builds and starts all services defined in docker-compose.yml.

Access the application:

Open your browser at http://localhost:[port] (replace [port] with the port in docker-compose.yml or .env, e.g., 3000).
[Add specific endpoints, e.g., "API available at http://localhost:3000/api"]



Option 2: Using Docker Directly

Run a container:
docker run --publish [host-port]:[container-port] [your-app-name]:latest

Example:
docker run --publish 3000:3000 [your-app-name]:latest


Access the application as described above.


Stopping the Application

Using Docker Compose:Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes:
docker compose down


Using Docker Directly:Stop the running container:
docker container stop $(docker container ls --quiet --filter ancestor=[your-app-name]:latest)

Find the container ID:
docker container ls



Troubleshooting

Port Conflicts:Modify the host port in docker-compose.yml or the docker run command (e.g., --publish 8080:3000).
Build Errors:Check Dockerfile and .dockerignore for issues. View build logs:docker build -t [your-app-name]:latest .


Container Logs:Check runtime errors:docker container logs <container_id>


[Add application-specific troubleshooting tips, e.g., database connection issues.]
