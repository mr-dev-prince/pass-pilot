## Overview

**Pass-Pilot** is a full-stack password manager application. It consists of:

- A React-based frontend for user interaction

- A Node.js + Express backend providing secure REST APIs

- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for persistent data storage

The app is fully containerized using Docker, and managed with Docker Compose for easy orchestration of services.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Docker

- Docker Compose

âœ… Verify Installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Project Structure

project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/ # React frontend source code
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/ # Node.js backend source code
â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml # Multi-service orchestration file
â””â”€â”€ README.Docker.md # This documentation

## Setup Instructions

- 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pass-pilot.git
cd pass-pilot
```

- 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in both the frontend/ and backend/ directories as needed.

### Use .env.sample given in both directories to populate your .env file

## Running the Application

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method spins up both frontend and backend together.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Access the app:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

- Backend API: http://localhost:3000/api

### Using Docker Directly

To build and run containers individually:

- Build the Backend:

```bash
docker build -t pass-pilot-backend ./backend
docker run -p 3000:3000 pass-pilot-backend
```

- Build the Frontend:

```bash
docker build -t pass-pilot-frontend ./frontend
docker run -p 5173:5173 pass-pilot-frontend
```

### Stopping the Application

- Using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Using Docker CLI:

```bash
docker container stop $(docker container ls --quiet --filter ancestor=pass-pilot-backend)
docker container stop $(docker container ls --quiet --filter ancestor=pass-pilot-frontend)
```

### Troubleshooting

Problem Solution

- Port Already in Use : Change port in docker-compose.yml or .env
- Build Fails : Check Dockerfile, .dockerignore, or rebuild with --no-cache
- MongoDB Fails : Ensure correct Atlas URI and whitelist IPs in MongoDB Atlas
- Container Crashes : View logs: **docker container logs <container_id>**
